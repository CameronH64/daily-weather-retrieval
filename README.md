# Installation Instructions for Development

1. Clone github repository to local computer.
2. Open Pycharm
3. Configure an interpreter; this makes the virtual environment that you need.
4. Install all pip packages from requirements.txt in the virtual environment. Use "pip install -r requirements.txt" command.
5. Copy necessary files into the project folder that aren't pip dependencies (in this case, .env).
6. Add a python run configuration for the .py file, main. This lets you run that python file.
